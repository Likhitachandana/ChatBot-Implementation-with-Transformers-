# ChatBot-Implementation-with-Transformers-
To construct the Seq2Seq AI Chatbot, we employed an encoder-decoder attention mechanism architecture. Indeed, it is a typical method for creating Seq2Seq AI Chatbots. Two RNNs—an encoder RNN and a decoder RNN—make up the encoder-decoder attention mechanism architecture.
